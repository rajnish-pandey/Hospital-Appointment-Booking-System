# Hospital-Appointment-Booking-System
A web based application for Hospital Management. Using this application patients can book their appointment from doctors of reputed hospitals.
At the same, the hospitals will also be able to see the appointments of the patients, by selecting a appointment ID.
The appointment ID will be randomly generated when an appointment is being booked.

Before booking the appointment, the patients can see the details of the doctors, and book the appointment accordingly.

Also, the patient may book(sign up) for a hospital to receive timely updates, about information related to health. After this, the 
hospital can mail the related information to the patients.
